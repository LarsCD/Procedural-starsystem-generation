In this project I explored the procedrual generation of starsystems

# Functionality:

## Generate planet
  ### Generate type of planet based on occurance in the real universe.
  ### From radius and planet composittion; generate mass, gravity at surface, and more.
  ### Further generate atmospheric composition-, pressure- and other atmospheric data.
  
## Generate stellar object
  ### Generate type of star, neutron star or black hole based on occurance in the real universe.
  ### Generate class and (solar)mass

## Generate starsystem
  ### Generate single or binary starsystem (one or two stars in the system)
  ### Generate stars
  ### Generate planets and put them at realistic scale from the center of mass from the star
  ### Calculate metadata for the planets; distance from star and orbital period (in earth years)

## Seeds
  ### Every system, stellar object and planet generated has a unique seed
